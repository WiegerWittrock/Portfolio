# Portfolio
Personal portfolio website

This website is directly imported from the University of Twente Portfolio Servers, which are unfortunately shut down. The website is missing many images and videos, as GitHub doesn't accept files above 25mb. Still, it is a cool (but not up to date) portfolio of projects from my study Creative Technology.
