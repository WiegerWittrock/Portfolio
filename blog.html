            For the Profiling pillar in module 2, I updated my digital portfolio.
           I added all the cool things I made for all the courses in Module 1. I also included the 3d moddeling workshop! Later I will update my portfolio
           again with the projects of module 2!

      <h1>Video Review</h1>
      <address class="author">By Wieger Wittrock</address>

        <p>
            As the core of Module 1, we had to make a <a href="ximpel/notonmywatch.html" class="bloglink">interactive video</a>. In this blog post I will review
            a video from my classmates. <br>
            I reviewed the video from Video Project Group 5, you can see their video <a href="https://portfolio.cr.utwente.nl/student/ruijtermac/ximpel_example.htm" target="_blank" class="bloglink">here</a>.
            <br>
            I think it is a really good video. The video is about a guy who is in love with a girl. When it is getting more serious he gets to meet the girls parents, and even
            wants to marry the girl! The outcome of the proposal depends on your previous choices, which I think is really cool! I think the video is really
            entertaining and it contains sufficient freedom in interaction, and also of course in plot twist... (but that depends on what you chose). There
            were also a lot of locations where the video was made, which I think is nice.
            <br>
            I also liked how you could choose while the video is still running. The only thing that can maybe improve the video, is a bit more background music.


            <br><br><br>
            Our own video can have some improvements after seeing video's from others and after hearing feedback. Our video is all shot on one place,
            it would have been more interesting maybe to have some scenes play at a different location. Just like in the above video we should've also made it so
            you can see the choices while the video is still running, instead of cutting to a black screen. We also could've made it so there are different endings
            to our video to make it more fun to re<strong>watch</strong> the video.

          I reviewed the website of Hugo van't Riet. You can visit his website <a href="https://portfolio.cr.utwente.nl/student/hugo/index.html" target="_blank" class="bloglink">here</a>.
          <h3>Review</h3>
          Hugo's website was really good, it had a lot of information about himself and about his projects. The site immediately starts with personal information and a description, which I like.
          The design is consistent through the whole website, and it has personal design elements. One of the only things I did not like about the design was
          the grey background everywhere. The background makes it a bit difficult to know where you are on the website (maybe the pages could have different backgrounds). But the rest of the navigation works really
          well since the blog and the portfolio have there own seperate page. <br>There are already two blogposts on Hugo's portfolio page, they have a lot of information.
          He also uses many images inside the posts, which I like. The only thing that was still missing was a way to contact Hugo, but that could also be because
          I am reviewing his website on monday already when we need to hand it in on friday :)
          <h3>Reflection</h3>
            From reviewing I learnt some new cool things about design. I really liked the way Hugo had everything centered in his website, it makes it easy to read everyting.
            Also after looking in detail at the way he made his navigation bar, I learnt that when you put everything in the middle, you can scale the screen without really big
            overlapping of texts.
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <img src="img/hugocss.png" alt="CSS form Hugo" class="blogimage">
           The analysis is about the home/index page of Hugo's website. I especially like the looks of the navigation bar. By pressing Ctrl+U, we can see that Hugo's used
           "plain" HTML and CSS to make his website (no WordPress), which is good! He also didn't use a template.<br>
           By looking at the code and using the inspect function we find that the navigation bar is an unordered list. Every link is inside a list-element. In CSS we can see how he
             styled the navigation bar: <br>
             First, he uses "list-style-type: none", I actually didn't know what this exactly did. I looked it up and it removes the circles, that normally
             show that something is a list. Very clever! All the links inside the navigation bar are displayed as a block, so they are clearly seperated.
             He also uses "overflow: hidden;" so text will not be visible outside the boundaries.<br>
             The rest of the CSS is mostly used for design like colors and font. The rest of the page is text and a picture. He didn't use a gallery or JavaScript/JQuery/plugins.

      <h1>Personal touch</h1>
      <address class="author">By Wieger Wittrock</address>
      <span class="blogdate">Oct 18th, 2021</span>
    </div>
      <section class="content">

        <p>
          This blog post is about the personal touch of this website. I started from scratch and did not use a template. So everything I made,
          was made with a personal touch on this website. </p>

            <p>
            <img  class="blogimage" src="img/code2.png" alt="screen scale code">
            The first code I want to show you that contributed to the personal touch of this website, is showcased in this image.
            My header consist of 3 different buttons and a big home button. When you scale the screen-size down, then all the buttons will keep floating
            on their side of the screen: "portfolio" stays left, and "home" and "blog" stay to the right. The big home button will stay in the center.
            <br>If you scale the screen-size too far down however, then the buttons will overlap each other. The code from the picture prevents this.
            If the screen-size is smaller then 600px, then some stuff will happen.
            <br>First off, the buttons will no longer float to the right, or the left.
            <br>The buttons are now displayed as blocks, so instead of standing next to eachother the buttons now will be under eachother.
            <br>Also, the text in the buttons is now alligned to the left instead of the middle, because I thought that looked nicer.
          <br>Finally, all the images in the blog posts will stop floating and will also be displayed in blocks, simply because there is not many space
        left if all the images will be next to the text. </p>
            <p>
              The second piece of code is about the background color of the website. As you can see behind this blog post, the background color is not a single color.
              Instead it is a linear-gradient from four colors. I chose these four colors, (Electric Blue, Celeste, Spring Green and Emerald) because I like
              them and because I think they fit with eachother as a background. The gradient goes from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
              I also made a background color for browsers that do not support the gradient. <br>
              The usefull thing of css is that now the background color will be the same for every page on this website, by only using one piece of code!
            </p>

          This is an update on how it is going with our video project! For We Create Identity we have to make a video where the viewer can choose which path
          the video will go on. This is a really cool idea, and our group is making a lot of progress already. A very important part of the video is of course the story
          and the choices the viewer can make. Our idea was to film a reunion of highschool friends, they will have a fancy dinner at someones place. One of the friends however
          doesn't have a fancy suit and the rich host (me!) is a bit arrogant to the poor friend.
          <br>
          What the host doesn't know is that the poor friend has a sick child. In desperate need of money, the poor friend steals from the rich host, but the main character
          (who knows about the situation of the poor friend) notices the theft...
          <br>
          From this point on, the viewer can chose to help to poor friend stealing, tell the host, try to resolve the problem yourself or even call the cops.
          <br><br>
          Yesterday we had a meeting with a teacher about our story, we changed a bit of the choices but the main story was alright!
          We also made a story tree which you can see <a href="files/StoryBoard.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="bloglink">here.</a>
          <br>
          We are now still working with story improvements, and we started a bit with writing the script.

          <a href="https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/" target="_blank" class="bloglink">Bol.com</a>
          is a webshop in the Netherlands and offers general merchandising products in many categories.
          The website has a lot of users, mainly by the good service, many different products to buy and the short delivery time.
          As of 2020, the store serves 11 million active customers in the Netherlands and Belgium and offers over 23 million items.
          Since 2011, bol.com has also opened its webshop for retailers to sell and effectively became a platform.
          Since the introduction of "Selling via bol.com", more than 30,000 retailers have already sold via bol.com.
          The company employs approximately 2,000 workers.

          Hello, this is an update on a project I am currently working on. As part of the Programming course,
          we need to make a interactive creature in the programming language: Processing.
          This is going really well and I am proud of the creature I have right now.
          <br>
          As you can see on the picture, I made a bird. If the mouse gets too close to the bird,
          the bird will start flying away from the mouse. But if you manage to click on the bird with the mouse,
          then you can drag the bird through the sky.
          Another function of the bird is that you can change all his colors (his eyes, body, wings, etc) by pressing the number-keys on your keyboard.
          I recently "moved" all the code for my bird to three different scripts,
          so it will be much more organized and easier to carry on with the assignment.
