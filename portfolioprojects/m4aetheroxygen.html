For the core project of module 4 we were assigned to work for the annual GOGBOT festival in Enschede. The theme of the festival this year was "So future - from
metaf*ck to solarpunk". The project was done in groups of 7 people. We made an interactive experience that let people feel how breathing in the future would
look like. The story was that due to climate change the air outside would not be breathable anymore in the future, luckily the company Aether Oxygen (we)
developped a backback that allows the wearer to breath outside again! But these backpacks are not cheap...
<br>This is the future, where companies are starting to become more important and powerfull than the governments. I was mainly in charge of the company
part of the project (like the posters and the setup).
<br>The final setup was split up into two parts. The first part showcased the backpack and all the advertisements and posters. If the users puts on the
backpack he could walk to the second part of the setup: the future. In this section the user can see on his wristband screen that the air quality is very bad.
This make the user think, is this really the future I want to live in?
