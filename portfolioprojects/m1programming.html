    <p> This course consists of multiple programming exercises. The first exercise was to make a creature in the programming
      langauge Processing. I was busy making a bird, and it is now finished! In the following pictures you can see the design tree and you can see the birds in its full glory!

  As you can see, a lot has changed since I posted the blog post. Now there are many birds, and they actually flap their wings and go up and down. You can also drag a bird and
  throw it to a wall, it will even bounce back (no wonder the birds are fleeing from you...). You can reset the position and the speed of the birds, and finally, you can change their colors!

The final programming assignment was to animate a shop window in Processing. I chose the shop "By Jan Marc" in Hengelo. This is how it turned out:

  <p>And this is the design. As you can see, this program much more complex than the creature program.</p>

  <p>Finally we also had a sportsday programming. I spent this entire day programming with a team. We had to make a program out of three words and present it.
  Our words were: Bunny, Pirate and Snowboarding. This is what we made:</p>

<script>
//Get the button
var mybutton = document.getElementById("backToTop");

// When the user scrolls down 20px from the top of the document, show the button
window.onscroll = function() {scrollFunction()};

function scrollFunction() {
  if (document.body.scrollTop > 20 || document.documentElement.scrollTop > 20) {
    mybutton.style.display = "block";
  } else {
    mybutton.style.display = "none";
  }
}

// When the user clicks on the button, scroll to the top of the document
function topFunction() {
  window.scrollTo({top: 0, behavior: 'smooth'}); } </script>
