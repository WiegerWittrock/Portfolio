    <p>For the course Visual Communication we had to design faces. First we needed to make a stroy from some headlines from the New York Times.
      Based on this story, you needed to design 3 faces that matched the story. Every face also has a tonality word, like Relief, Love or Stress.
      This was my story: <br><br>
      <em>Meet two lovers, <br>
      Ted and Katrina’s future will never be same <br>
      after Ted becomes a famous scientist. <br>
      However, he’s slowly losing his mind by all the pressure. <br>
      His love Katrina saved him from ruin by making retirement plans. <br>
      They will ditch the city and run a farm. <br>
      It was just what they needed. </em>


      <br><br> These were my first 3 faces:
   </p>
</div>

<img class="m1viscom" src="../img/m1viscomlove.png" alt="love">
<img class="m1viscom" src="../img/m1viscomstress.png" alt="stress">
<img class="m1viscom" src="../img/m1viscomrelief.png" alt="relief">

<div class="homepage">
The next assignment was to make a 3d-face, this could be made out of anything. I decided that i wanted to make a 3d-heart, since that would fit with my story.
After some painting and glueing, this was my 3d face:
</div>
<img class="m1viscom" src="../img/3dface1.jpg" alt="relief">
<div class="homepage">
The next assignment was to re-brand your faces. You now didn't need the story anymore. You needed to come up with a popular brand that would fit one of your faces.
We then needed to present our faces with the logo of this famous brand, and with a selfmade slogan that would fit the style of the company. The final
assignment was to make this re-branded faces into a poster. These are my posters:
</div>
<img class="m1viscom" src="../img/m1viscomwarchild.gif" alt="war child">
<img class="m1viscomPoster" src="../img/m1viscomunhcr.gif" alt="unhcr">
<br><br>
<a onclick="topFunction()" id="backToTop" title="Go to top" class="footera"><img src="../img/uparrow.png" alt="Top" class="footericon"></a>
<script>
//Get the button
var mybutton = document.getElementById("backToTop");

// When the user scrolls down 20px from the top of the document, show the button
window.onscroll = function() {scrollFunction()};

function scrollFunction() {
  if (document.body.scrollTop > 20 || document.documentElement.scrollTop > 20) {
    mybutton.style.display = "block";
  } else {
    mybutton.style.display = "none";
  }
}

// When the user clicks on the button, scroll to the top of the document
function topFunction() {
  window.scrollTo({top: 0, behavior: 'smooth'}); } </script>

  </body>
</html>
