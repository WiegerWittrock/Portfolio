    <p>As my final assignment for the subject computer science in 6VWO, I made a game together
with another student using Unity. I worked really hard on it and spent a lot of time making
the game. The project turned out to be the best final assignment the teacher had ever seen!
I really liked making the pixel art for the weapons and the player. We also made most of the
ground textures ourselves using Photoshop.<br>
You are a farmer on a island, but when you are sleeping the island gets overrun by monsters. You must restore peace to the island and defeat the monsters.
There are many different biomes on the island, you have: The Grasslands, The Hills, The Farms, The Riversides, The Town, The Bay, The Desert, The Vulcano, The Forrest, The Cave, The Beach, The Rock-City and The Mountain.
Spread across the biomes are also different monsters to find, some larger biomes also have a bossfight! To find your way easily across the island, we added a map.
   </p>

On the island are many secrets to uncover, there are for example chests with different rarities and you can also find breakable pots. By opening chests, pots
  or defeating monsters the playes is rewarded with gold. In the town you can spend your gold on healthpotions or you can upgrade your gear. You beat the game
  if you kill the final boss.
  <br> Since the game is very big and the player can collect gold and weapons, we decided to add a save and load function, this was very challenging.
  However, the most challenging part was to add the story-challenges. We also added a lot of soundeffects and music, and even a cutscene!
