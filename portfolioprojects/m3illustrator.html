    <p>I followed an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib8UBwu3yGA">online</a> Illustrator course on YouTube. <br>
      The course consists of 19 small lessons about Adobe Illustrator. Illustrator is a vector-based designing and drawing program. It looks a bit like
      Photoshop, but it used for drawings and designing. The 19 lessons all covered a specific tool or feature from Illustrator.

Here are some examples of things covered in the lessons:
<br>
Using the classic shapes like a rectangle, ellipse and a line, I made this simple drawing.

This was later on improved, as more tools were covered:

  <p>
    Illustrator is also a very good program to make Logo's. This logo could be used if Gmail bought Netflix, for example.

    Now it became more serious. He explained new tools that made it possible to draw anything, so not only squares and circles. I practiced this by
    copying shapes. Also more coloring methods were introduced.

    Illustrator is often used to edit pictures, for example by adding shapes or converting the picture into a drawing and editing the colors.

    You can also edit text in many different ways.

    I really liked the course. I learnt a lot of things and Illustrator is very usefull program to increase the aestetics of your reports or presentations for example.
    Now that I knew how Illustrator worked, I started on my own project. I challenged myself to draw the startscreen of a Iphone! I used almost all the
    tools covered in the lessons and I learnt many new ones aswell. This is how it went:

  <p>
  Some of my apps, look really identical!

  <p>
  This is the final product. I am really happy about it, even though it took very long to make. I think I did a good job and it looks just like the real
  Iphone design.

    <script>
    //Get the button
    var mybutton = document.getElementById("backToTop");

    // When the user scrolls down 20px from the top of the document, show the button
    window.onscroll = function() {scrollFunction()};

    function scrollFunction() {
      if (document.body.scrollTop > 20 || document.documentElement.scrollTop > 20) {
        mybutton.style.display = "block";
      } else {
        mybutton.style.display = "none";
      }
    }

    // When the user clicks on the button, scroll to the top of the document
    function topFunction() {
      window.scrollTo({top: 0, behavior: 'smooth'}); } </script>
