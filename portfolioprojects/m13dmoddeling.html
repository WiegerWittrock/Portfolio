    <p>The workshop was not what I expected, I expected we were going to learn how
      to make some 3d models in programs like Blender. Instead it was just an extension
       of the programming course, but now with 3d shapes instead of 2d ones.
       So the workshop was a bit disappointing. The end goal of the workshop was
       to make a program were a red ball and a blue ball can play hide and seek.
      The area where they could hide was just a rectangle and the only things you could hide behind were more rectangles.
      The workshop was difficult, which also made it way harder to actually make things
      yourself, the entire workshop was just an explanation of one big hide-and-seek-program,
      which had not that much to do with 3d-moddeling, but more with programming.
      However, I did of course learn much about 3d shapes in the programming language Processing.
      In fact, this already helped me in my further development as CreaTer for my final Programming assignment.
