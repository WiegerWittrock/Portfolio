    <p>I started by creating a creative coding account. You can find me and my project <a href="https://openprocessing.org/user/300564?view=activity">here</a>. I looked at many tutorials and at some already submitted works by other people. I initially thought that this website was for the programming language Processing (also the name is openProcessing), but it turns out that the Processing language is no longer supported on this website. So instead the website mainly uses JavaScript, this is were processing is actually based off, so there are many similarities. Nevertheless, it was way more difficult to program in JavaScript.
After looking at many tutorials, there were two I really liked and you can check them out here: <br><br>

 <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/858175/">Drawing Context</a>, I learnt about shadows and noise from this tutorial, which I also implemented in my own project. <br>
<a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/843344/">Interactive Mondrian Tutorial</a>, I just liked this program and how it was explained, but I did not use this for my own sketch. I did help me to learn the JavaScript language, like all the other tutorials and programs I looked into. <br><br>
</p>

<p><strong>My project:</strong> <br>
I made a program in JavaScript were you can draw very cool trails and patterns, by using the mouse. There also are 5 different circles that move and draw by themselves, this was the most difficult part of the program. When you click the mouse, the other circles will explode, creating a cool effect. I really like how the project turned out, you can really make cool backgrounds with this program.
When the mouse is on the left side of the screen the color of the circles and their trails will be red. If the mouse is on the right side, then the color will be green. Just like most creative coding programs, there is not a lot of interaction with the user with the program. You just got to sit down and watch! I think that i found a good middle between this, where the player still has some control, but not much.

When creating this project there were many different phases. First off, I just started coding and it worked really well. I quickly made it so you can control a circle and that you could draw (in grey color). Then it became a bit more difficult and I didn't really know how to carry on, so i made it so the circle would change size according to the speed of the mouse. I knew how you could do this, so it went great again!
But then it became really tricky. I wanted to use the shadow and noise from the first tutorial I showed, but this was very difficult. Because everything was in JavaScript I had a hard time implementing and improving these features. I didn't made a lot of progress. But eventially it worked and I was really happy.
Finally I added 4 more balls that move by themselves. <br><br>

I uploaded my program to the website and you can also see it <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1374370">here</a>. I hope the other people like it too.
