      In the first week of the module, I followed a blender beginners guide. Blender is a 3d-moddeling program where you can make almost anything into
      high quality rendered images or video's. You can make very realistic models, or something very abstract! I always wanted to learn blender, as I
      knew that the program is often used alongside with Unity. But before making games with models from blender, I first wanted to know how to make those
      models.<br><br>
      I followed a complete beginners guide on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnj2BL4chaQ&list=PLn3ukorJv4vuU3ILv3g3xnUyEGOQR-D8J&index=3">YouTube</a>,
       consisting of 8 lessons. The guide was very usefull, as I already had to use Blender for another
      subject this module. The guide is for beginners, but he also teaches you handy shortcuts and many different ways to approach problems in blender.
      The first lessons were very general about shapes and tools, while the last 6 lessons were about making a scene with a monster and an old man.
      I found the way of teaching very nice, he asked you to do something and pause the video, and then he would do it and explain. In this way you are
      the one making the scene, and you are not exactly copying from him.

      This is the final result:

    <script>
    //Get the button
    var mybutton = document.getElementById("backToTop");

    // When the user scrolls down 20px from the top of the document, show the button
    window.onscroll = function() {scrollFunction()};

    function scrollFunction() {
      if (document.body.scrollTop > 20 || document.documentElement.scrollTop > 20) {
        mybutton.style.display = "block";
      } else {
        mybutton.style.display = "none";
      }
    }

    // When the user clicks on the button, scroll to the top of the document
    function topFunction() {
      window.scrollTo({top: 0, behavior: 'smooth'}); } </script>

  </body>
