      For the project of module 2 we had to make a program that helps solving climate change or the problems caused by it. First we
      had to find a lot of information about the topic. After that we chose a problem that we wanted o solve. We chose the problem
      water waste in agriculture.
      <br> <br>90% of all the usable water goes to agriculture, but 70% of this water is wasted! In the future there will be a big water shortage caused by
      the climate change and the growing population, if we don't take actions now. Also food will become an issue when there is a water waste.
      Since water and food are the most important things we need to live, we chose to find a solution for this problem.
      <br> Our solution was to make a program that helps farmers optimize their water usage in an irrigation system. I made a Processing program
      that reads the real-time weather forecast of its location. Using this information and using multiple sensors on the arduino like temperature and
      humidity, we can calculate a suggested irrigation usage. In this way water is saved since most of the time an irrigation system is on or off, it
      is not "smart", but now it can be smart.
      <br> To test the program we connected it to plants and we used a soil-moisture sensor to know if the plant needs water. Then the program
      will look at sensor values and the weather forcast and make a decision. For example, only use 60% irrigation today, since it is expected to rain
      in the afternoon.

    //Get the button
    var mybutton = document.getElementById("backToTop");
