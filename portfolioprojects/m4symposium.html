    I followed the Proto Symposium on may 18th. During the Symposium multiple companies talked about topics like sustainability, cyber security, robotics
    and user experience. There were two presentations and two workshops. I followed the presentations of Hike One and Robor, and I followed the workshops
    from Roboteam and Thales.<br> During the Roboteam workshop we had to program a robot with sensors that would have to sumo wrestle with the other robots.
    Our robot did not last very long, but I still really liked the workshop and learned a lot.
    <br> The Thales workshop was really cool. Everyone was divided into multiple groups that represent one faction that could be involved during a cyber
    attack, for example the bakkery, bank, government and Thales themselves. Then, each group would get some information about the same event, but you decide
    how much you want to share that with the other groups. This lead to a very funny story that was not at all true, this showed how it goes in the real
    world, you shouldn't always trust the media.
