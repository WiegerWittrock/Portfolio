      For the project: Living and Working Tomorrow, I worked in a team for a client: the organiser of the DID22.
      The Dutch Innovation Days took place in Enschede from the 20th to the 24th of April,
      and 5 groups were assigned to help the clients to create an interactive art
      installation for the visitors of the festival. The main theme of the festival this year was Magic Minds, which consists
      of 5 sub-themes: Health, Food, Fashion, Energy and Waste. The philosophy behind the main theme is that technology is like magic, and it should be used to fix the world.
      The Dutch Innovation Days was organized so people can meet these “Magic Minds” and experience the technology that will define the future
      of those five sub-themes.
<br><br>
      The clients from the company Knyfe have approached the University of Twente, specifically Creative Technology,
      and assigned 5 groups to create an installation using 5 glass-steel pillars, which were placed at the exposition
      in the U-Connect building, which was one of the locations of the Dutch Innovation Days. These pillars were previously
      used for other purposes like product display, and they are made of heavy steel, with a three sided glass panel showcase.
      Behind the showcase, facing forward, is a large vertical screen, and a Leap Motion sensor is attached to the front of the pillar.
<br><br>
      Our group was assigned to the Innovation of Waste. The project description was:
      ‘When waste becomes a problem some see this abundance as a solution. What if leftovers become more valuable than
      the original. Maybe the trash from our kitchen is our food for the day after, is nature itself capable of fixing the world?
      What’s your role in untrashing the world?’.

<p> We decided to make a rope-pulling game called The Last Strand. The goal is to lift the weight in the middle by pulling the ropes. The problem however
is that the weight is too heavy to lift on your own, you need help from other visitors of the DID to lift the weight. The same goes for the
problem of waste, alone you cannot fix it, but together it is way easier!
<br>A timer on the screen inside the pillar shows how long the weight has been lifted without letting it touch the ground. This was
only possible if visitors would pass the ropes to different visitors, which is what they did luckily! The record time came out to be around 43 minutes, of
which I am very proud!</p>

    Especially children liked the interface of the screen, which motivated them to pull longer!
