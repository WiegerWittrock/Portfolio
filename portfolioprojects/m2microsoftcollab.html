    <p>I followed an <a href="https://www.goodhabitz.com/en-gb/online-courses/categories/digital-skills/office-365/">online training</a> from Goodhabitz. <br>
      The training was about the collaboration between microsoft office 365 apps.
      I chose this training because we use the Microsoft applications very often for school, but also for personal use. Improving my knowledge about these apps and how you can collaborate with them, will help me in my further development as a professional.
<br>
The training consist of 5 lessons, each starting with a manual followed by examples. All the examples have questions you have to answer yourself to make sure you understand and remember. A lesson is finished if you complete all the examples. The entire
training is finished when you pass the final test.
<br><br>

Here are some examples I learned:
<br>
When working in a group you can see someone's availability, in for example Teams:
</p>
</div>
<img class="m1viscom" src="../img/teams.png" alt="teams">

<div class="homepage">
  <p>
But when you are "busy", your group members won't know why. So instead it might be useful to also share your calendar with them like this:
  </p>
</div>
<img class="m1viscom" src="../img/calendar.png" alt="teams">

<br><br>
<div class="homepage">
  <p>
    The online training mainly focuses on the use of fewer known office apps, like Planner.
    Planner is an app you can use when you need to devide tasks for a big project with your group.
    But you can also use it for yourself. This is how Planner could look for making a presentation:

  </p>
</div>
<img class="m1viscom" src="../img/planner.png" alt="teams">



<div class="homepage">
  <p>
    You divide the project into smaller tasks so it looks more clear. You can add all sorts of stuff to your tasks. For example: Who is doing it, what programs to use, images, end date and start date and also sub tasks (like testing the presentation).
    So now, we can also see these tasks in Teams:

  </p>
</div>
<img class="m1viscom" src="../img/teams2.png" alt="teams">

<div class="homepage">
  <p>
    From here, you can do all kinds of different stuff of course! Planner is a really usefull application I could use for future projects.

    <script>
    //Get the button
    var mybutton = document.getElementById("backToTop");

    // When the user scrolls down 20px from the top of the document, show the button
    window.onscroll = function() {scrollFunction()};

    function scrollFunction() {
      if (document.body.scrollTop > 20 || document.documentElement.scrollTop > 20) {
        mybutton.style.display = "block";
      } else {
        mybutton.style.display = "none";
      }
    }

    // When the user clicks on the button, scroll to the top of the document
    function topFunction() {
      window.scrollTo({top: 0, behavior: 'smooth'}); } </script>
